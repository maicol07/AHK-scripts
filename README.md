# Personal AHK scripts

These are my personal [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) scripts to improve my overall typing and apps experience. You can find the description of them in every file.

Some notes:

- Sharemouse patch: fixes an issue with Sharemouse license registration where after system reboot the license key is unregistered by simply getting the trial expired and re-register the key (must be provided in a `vars.ini` file under the key `Sharemouse/licensekey`). It's split in two scripts.
- You can run this scripts at startup creating a symlink to the script in the `shell:startup` folder.
